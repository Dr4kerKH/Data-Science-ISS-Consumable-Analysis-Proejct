## Comprehensive Analysis of International Space Station (ISS) Consumables fro Optimal Inventory Managment Project

### Overview
This project, a collaboration between *Barrios Technology* and *Angelo State University*, focuses on analyzing consumable usage rates aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The goal is to provide insights into historical consumption trends, optimize resupply logistics, and develop predictive models for future mission planning.

### Objectives
- Evaluate historical ISS consumable usage data and validate assumption accuracy.
- Predict future consumable requirements based on planned crew and supply schedules.
- Develop visual and statistical models for data-driven decision-making.
- Assess potential supply chain constraints and provide optimization strategies.

### Data Sources
- ISS Inventory Management System (IMS) historical data (last two years).
- ISS Flight Plan data (historical and projected for the next two years).
- Actual consumption data from Mission Control Center’s ECLSS Tracker.

### Key Analysis Areas
- Assumption Validation: Compare expected vs. actual consumable usage rates.
- Optimization Analysis: Determine minimum required resupply quantities.
- What-If Analysis: Adjust variables such as increased usage rates to assess impacts.
- Predictive Modeling: Forecast peak resupply periods and confidence intervals for future stock levels.
- Statistical Significance Testing: Identify meaningful variations in consumption rates over time.

### Requirements
- Load provided datasets into a relational SQL database.
- Utilize predictive modeling techniques for analysis.
- Implement effective data visualization techniques.
- Consider interactive features for “what-if” scenarios and collaboration.

### Deliverables
- Final Report: Includes data insights, methodologies, predictive modeling results, and technology stack.
- Presentation (15-20 min): Summarizing key findings and recommendations.
- Demonstration Video (2-5 min): Showcasing analysis and visualization outputs.

This project offers an opportunity to apply data engineering, analytics, and visualization skills to a real-world aerospace challenge while contributing to mission success for the ISS.
